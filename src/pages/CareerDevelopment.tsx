      <h2 className="blog-title">My main strength</h2>

        <p className="blog-paragraph">
          I spent four out of five years of my computer engineering studies as an apprentice so far. My academic studies gave me a solid theoretical foundation, personal exploration with true curiosity deepened my understanding, and real-world experience in companies taught me about teamwork, deadlines, project management, compromises, and addressing user needs. This combination has helped me develop a well-rounded skill set and the ability to tackle complex problems effectively, always keeping in mind what truly matters: performance and the end user.
