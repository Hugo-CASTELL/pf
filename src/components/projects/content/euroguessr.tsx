      <h2 className="blog-first-title">Euroguessr — guess the Eurovision song in 1 second</h2>

      <p className="blog-paragraph">
        Euroguessr is a lightweight, community-driven game for Eurovision fans: you hear only one second
        of a song and must guess the correct entry. Miss a guess and you'll earn extra seconds of audio —
        a simple mechanic that keeps rounds tense and fun while helping players discover new tracks.
      </p>

      <h2 className="blog-title">Overview</h2>
      <p className="blog-paragraph">
        The site was built with React and ships as an open-source project (logo, .NET, license details available
        in the repo). Its primary goal is entertainment and community engagement: test your knowledge, learn
        new songs, and contribute improvements.
      </p>

      <h2 className="blog-title">Where to play</h2>
      <p className="blog-paragraph">
        The live site is available at <a href="https://euroguessr.com">https://euroguessr.com</a> — go try today's
        challenge and see how well you know Eurovision!
      </p>
