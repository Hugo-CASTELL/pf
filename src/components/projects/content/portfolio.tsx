        I began creating my portfolio by designing every section in Figma, allowing me to experiment with layouts, colors, and visual hierarchy until I had a clear and cohesive structure.
      </p>
      <p className="blog-paragraph">
        Once the design foundation was set, I moved on to development, building the entire website from scratch. This approach gave me full control over the code, animations, and user experience.

      <p className="blog-paragraph">
        The process was both creative and technical, blending thoughtful design decisions with efficient front-end development to bring the concept to life.

      <h2 className="blog-title">A continuous work in progress</h2>
      <p className="blog-paragraph">
        As you could have saw if you checked the website before, I'm always continuing to work on it along side my other projects and career.
        Sometimes I intensively work on the Figma/Design aspect so visual result is shown later on!

      <p className="blog-paragraph">
        I’ll keep refining and improving the portfolio as I explore new tools, techniques, and ideas in design and development.
